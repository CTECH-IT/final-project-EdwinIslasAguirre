      data-image-description="With their 28 year partnership, you would expect them to win multiple awards no? Well they've been nominated for many awards throughout their time 
      but have only won 13 awards in the span of 28 years. Winning 6 grammys in the process, those being for their live album, 'Alive 2007' and 'Random Access Memories' (with their song 
      Get Lucky).">
